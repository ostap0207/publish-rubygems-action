# GitHub Action - Publish Gem to Rubygems

This is a GitHub Action written to streamline the Ruby gem publication process. The action sets the Gem Credentials using `RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` secret and then runs `rake release` in your project root. You can override this command by setting `RELEASE_COMMAND` environment variable to the script that creates and publishes (this is usually only the case when a repository hosts multiple gems together).

# Secrets Needed

`RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` - The Rubygems API Key for an Owner of the Gem you wish to publish. You can find your API Key by looking in `~/.gem/credentials` or using the [Rubygems API](https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#misc-methods).

# Environment Variables

`RELEASE_COMMAND` - By default, this will invoke `rake release` to build and publish the gem to Rubygems. Set this environment variable if you have a custom release command to be invoked.

`WORKDIR` - Sets the workdir where bundle and the release will be run

`GIT_EMAIL`/`GIT_NAME` - A git identity you wish the tags to by published by.
